# NodeJS Template Repo

If prompted to install VS Code extensions, do it!

After **cloning** this repo to your computer (remember - don't `clone` into another repo!), don't forget to run: `npm i` and then `cd` into the newly created repo.

## Thoughts

Well, first of all, I forgot to do the **npm i** before starting this project, so now I'm not sure if I did it right 🙃

It took me a while to get it to show up correctly in my terminal, but it was mostly dumb stuff like using ' instead of ` 🙄

I think I prefer the arrow function over the template literal, but at first (_I'm assuming because of the learning curve I experienced_😒), I preferred the original way of writing it. Now that I've practiced and understand using the more modern approaches, I feel a lot better about them. I think I like the conciseness of the 🏹 function, I don't have much to go off of yet so who knows 🤷🏽
